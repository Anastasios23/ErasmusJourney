I studied business at UPC and made friends from all over the world. The city's perfect blend of history and modernity, combined with the warm Mediterranean climate, made it an ideal place for studying abroad. I explored every neighborhood, tried amazing tapas, learned to appreciate flamenco, and even picked up some Catalan phrases. This experience truly broadened my perspective and gave me confidence to pursue my dreams globally.",
