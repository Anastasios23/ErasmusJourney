        overallDescription: "My semester in Prague was absolutely transformative! The city's rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant student life created the perfect environment for both academic growth and personal discovery. From wandering through the medieval streets of Old Town to studying in libraries that felt like palaces, every day brought new adventures. The local students were incredibly welcoming, and I made lifelong friendships while exploring Czech culture, trying traditional food like goulash and trdeln√≠k, and traveling to nearby countries on weekends. This experience broadened my worldview and gave me confidence I never knew I had.",
        academicExperience: "Charles University exceeded all my expectations. The professors were knowledgeable and encouraged international perspectives in discussions. My favorite course was 'European Business Strategy' which gave me insights I couldn't get back home. The university's libraries and facilities were world-class, and the international student office provided excellent support throughout my stay.",
        culturalExperience: "Prague's culture is a beautiful blend of medieval charm and modern innovation. I loved attending classical concerts at historic venues, exploring art galleries, and participating in traditional festivals. The Christmas markets were magical! Learning basic Czech helped me connect with locals, who shared fascinating stories about their city's history.",
        challenges: "The main challenge was the language barrier initially, but people were patient and helpful. The weather was much colder than Cyprus, so I had to adapt my wardrobe. Sometimes I felt homesick, especially during holidays, but the international student community became my second family.",
        personalGrowth: "This experience taught me independence, adaptability, and openness to new perspectives. I became more confident in navigating unfamiliar situations and learned to appreciate different ways of life. I also improved my English and picked up some Czech phrases!",
        recommendations: "Don't hesitate to try local food, even if it seems unusual! Join student organizations and clubs - it's the best way to make friends. Travel as much as possible on weekends; Europe is so accessible from Prague. And definitely learn some basic Czech phrases; locals really appreciate the effort.",

        overallDescription: "Barcelona was the perfect city for an architecture student! Studying Gaud√≠'s masterpieces in person while living in this vibrant Mediterranean city was a dream come true. The combination of incredible architecture, delicious food, beautiful beaches, and welcoming people made this the best experience of my university years. I improved my Spanish, made international friends, and gained a new perspective on sustainable urban design that will influence my career forever.",
        academicExperience: "The architecture program at UPC was exceptional. We had site visits to iconic buildings like Casa Batll√≥ and La Sagrada Fam√≠lia. The professors were practicing architects who shared real-world insights. Working on a sustainable housing project for Barcelona's neighborhoods was challenging but incredibly rewarding.",
        culturalExperience: "Living in Barcelona means embracing the Mediterranean lifestyle - late dinners, afternoon siestas, and socializing until early morning. I fell in love with tapas culture, flamenco dancing, and the passionate way Catalans discuss their city's future. The art scene is incredible - from Picasso Museum to street art in El Raval.",
        challenges: "The fast-paced Catalan dialect was challenging at first, and the different academic schedule took some adjustment. Finding affordable housing near the university was competitive, but the student housing office helped me find a great shared apartment with local students.",
        personalGrowth: "This experience made me more creative and confident in expressing my ideas. Living with Spanish flatmates improved my language skills dramatically and taught me about Spanish family values and traditions. I also became more environmentally conscious, inspired by Barcelona's smart city initiatives.",
        recommendations: "Join the architecture student association - they organize amazing field trips! Try to live with local students rather than just internationals to really improve your Spanish. Explore beyond the touristy areas; neighborhoods like Gr√†cia and Poblenou have amazing hidden gems.",

        overallDescription: "Berlin offered me the perfect combination of cutting-edge technology, rich history, and incredible nightlife. As an engineering student, I was amazed by Germany's industrial heritage and innovation. The city's startup ecosystem, world-class universities, and multicultural environment created endless opportunities for learning and networking. From visiting Siemens factories to partying in underground clubs, Berlin showed me that work-life balance is essential for creativity and innovation.",
        academicExperience: "TU Berlin's engineering program is world-renowned for a reason. The labs are equipped with the latest technology, and professors are leaders in their fields. I particularly enjoyed the 'Industry 4.0' course where we worked with real automotive companies. The emphasis on sustainability and green technology aligns perfectly with my career goals.",
        culturalExperience: "Berlin's history is fascinating and tragic, but the city has rebuilt itself as a symbol of freedom and creativity. I visited historical sites like the Brandenburg Gate and Berlin Wall, but also experienced the vibrant art scene in neighborhoods like Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. The city never sleeps, and there's always something happening.",
        challenges: "German bureaucracy can be overwhelming for international students - so many forms and procedures! The winter was harsh and dark, which affected my mood initially. Also, making German friends took patience since they can seem reserved at first, but once you break the ice, they're incredibly loyal and fun.",
        personalGrowth: "This experience taught me the importance of precision and methodology in engineering - very German traits that I now apply to my work. I also learned to appreciate different approaches to problem-solving and became more environmentally conscious through exposure to Germany's sustainability initiatives.",
        recommendations: "Learn German before you go - it makes a huge difference in connecting with locals and understanding the culture. Take advantage of the excellent public transportation to explore other German cities. Join student organizations and sports clubs to meet people. And don't miss the Christmas markets in winter!",

        storyTitle: "Psychology Studies in Vienna - A Cultural Journey",
        overallDescription: "Vienna, the city of Freud, was the perfect place to study psychology! The combination of imperial architecture, rich intellectual history, and world-class coffee culture created an inspiring environment for deep thinking and learning. I gained new perspectives on human behavior while immersing myself in Austrian culture, from opera performances to philosophical discussions in traditional coffeehouses. This experience broadened my understanding of European psychology traditions and gave me lifelong memories.",
        academicExperience: "The University of Vienna's psychology department has an incredible reputation. Studying where Freud once walked was surreal! The professors emphasized both theoretical knowledge and practical applications. My favorite course was 'Cross-Cultural Psychology' which perfectly complemented my international experience. The research opportunities were excellent.",
        culturalExperience: "Vienna's cultural scene is unmatched. I attended operas at the State Opera House, visited art museums like the Belvedere, and spent countless hours in traditional coffeehouses reading and writing. The Viennese take their cultural heritage seriously, and I learned to appreciate classical music, art, and intellectual discourse.",
        challenges: "The formal Austrian communication style took some getting used to after the more relaxed Cypriot approach. The cost of living was higher than expected, especially dining out. Winter was long and dark, but the beautiful Christmas markets and cozy coffeehouses made it bearable.",
        personalGrowth: "This experience deepened my analytical thinking and cultural sensitivity - essential skills for a psychologist. I became more independent and confident in academic discussions. Living in Vienna also taught me to slow down and appreciate life's finer details, like the art of coffee drinking and classical music.",
        recommendations: "Take advantage of the student discounts for cultural events - Vienna offers so much! Learn some German basics; Austrians appreciate the effort. Explore the coffeehouse culture; it's where you'll have the best conversations. Don't miss day trips to Salzburg and the Danube Valley.",
