```

### University Ranking Algorithm

```typescript
// Multi-factor ranking system
const universityScore = weightedAverage([
  { value: averageRating, weight: 0.35 },
  { value: totalSubmissions, weight: 0.25 },
  { value: academicPerformance, weight: 0.25 },
  { value: partnershipLongevity, weight: 0.15 },
