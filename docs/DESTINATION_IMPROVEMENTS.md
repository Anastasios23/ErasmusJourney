# Destination System Improvements

This document outlines the major improvements made to centralize and enhance the destination system in the Erasmus Journey Platform.

## Overview

The destination system has been refactored from embedded data in individual pages to a centralized, API-driven architecture that supports user-generated content integration.

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized Data Source

**Before**: Destination data was embedded directly in `pages/destinations/[id].tsx` with duplicate and inconsistent information.

**After**:

- Base destination data comes from `src/data/destinations.ts`
- API endpoints provide enriched data combining base information with user submissions
- Consistent data structure across all destination-related features

### 2. API Architecture

**New API Endpoints**:

- `GET /api/destinations` - List all destinations with enriched data
- `GET /api/destinations/[id]` - Get specific destination with detailed information

**Data Enhancement**:

- Combines base destination data with user-generated content
- Adds calculated fields (population, currency, climate data)
- Prepares structure for future form submission integration

### 3. React Hooks for Data Fetching

**New Hooks** (`src/hooks/useDestinations.ts`):

- `useDestinations()` - Fetch all destinations
- `useDestination(id)` - Fetch specific destination by ID
- `useDestinationSearch(params)` - Search and filter destinations

**Benefits**:

- Consistent data fetching patterns
- Built-in caching with React Query
- Type-safe destination data
- Easy filtering and search capabilities

### 4. Enhanced Destination Detail Pages

**Improvements**:

- Uses centralized API data instead of embedded objects
- Integrates user-generated content from form submissions
- Responsive design with table of contents navigation
- Better accessibility and SEO
- Structured tabs for different information categories

**New Features**:

- User experiences section showing relevant form submissions
- Living costs breakdown
- Student life ratings
- Practical information (visa, healthcare, banking)
- Transportation details

### 5. User-Generated Content Integration

**Current State**: Infrastructure ready for integration
**Future Enhancement**: Form submissions will be automatically displayed on relevant destination pages

**Integration Points**:

- Student stories related to specific cities/countries
- Accommodation tips and reviews
- Course matching experiences
- Living cost insights from actual students

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

**Added Testing Setup**:

- Vitest configuration with jsdom environment
- @testing-library/react for component testing
- Sample tests for destination data validation
- `npm test` script now works correctly

**Current Tests**:

- Destination data structure validation
- Required fields verification
- Unique ID constraints
- Filtering functionality

## File Structure

```
# API Layer
pages/api/destinations/
├── index.ts          # List all destinations
└── [id].ts           # Get destination by ID

# Data Hooks
src/hooks/
└── useDestinations.ts # React Query hooks for destinations

# Enhanced Pages
pages/destinations/
└── [id].tsx          # Refactored detail page using centralized data

# Test Infrastructure
tests/
├── setup.ts          # Test configuration
└── utils/
    └── destinations.test.ts # Destination data tests

# Configuration
vitest.config.ts      # Test runner configuration
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for destination data
2. **Consistency**: Uniform data structure across all features
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new destinations or fields
4. **Performance**: Caching and optimized data fetching
5. **User Experience**: Rich, dynamic content with form integration ready
6. **Developer Experience**: Type-safe hooks and clear API contracts
7. **Testing**: Automated validation of data integrity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Form Integration**: Connect user submissions to destination pages
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options
3. **User Reviews**: Rating and review system for destinations
4. **Recommendations**: AI-driven destination recommendations
5. **Comparative Views**: Side-by-side destination comparisons

## Migration Notes

- Old embedded destination data has been removed
- Pages now use React Query for data fetching
- Error handling and loading states improved
- SEO and accessibility enhancements applied
- Responsive design patterns consistent across pages

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest --watch

# Run tests with UI
npx vitest --ui
```

## API Usage Examples

```typescript
// Fetch all destinations
const { data: destinations, isLoading } = useDestinations();

// Fetch specific destination
const { data: destination } = useDestination("berlin_germany");

// Search destinations
const { data: results } = useDestinationSearch({
  search: "engineering",
  country: "Germany",
  costLevel: "medium",
});
```
