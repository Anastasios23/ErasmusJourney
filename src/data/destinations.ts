      "Shop at Lidl and Aldi for groceries (save 40% compared to other stores). Get a monthly transport pass for ‚Ç¨86 - totally worth it. Many museums are free on certain days. For eating out, Turkish food is delicious and cheap!",

      "Barcelona is paradise! Beach, mountains, incredible architecture, and the food... don't get me started on the tapas! The nightlife is legendary - clubs open until 6 AM. Weather is perfect year-round. Only downside: very touristy in summer.",
    budgetTips:
      "Avoid restaurants near touristy areas - they're overpriced. Go to local markets like Boquer√≠a for fresh produce. Get a bicycle - it's the best way to explore and much cheaper than metro. Happy hour is from 6-8 PM in most bars!",
